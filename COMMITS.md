This style guide is used chiefly to test that aicommit follows the
style guide.

* Only provide a multi-line message when the change is non-trivial.
* For example, a few lines change is trivial. Prefer a single-line message.
* Most changes under 100 lines changed are trivial and only need a single-line message.
* Never begin the commit with an emoji.
* Mind standard Conventional Commits v1.0.0 using most appropriate type.
